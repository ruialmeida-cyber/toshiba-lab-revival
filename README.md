## 🌱 Introduction

I didn’t buy this laptop — I nearly forgot it existed.

My **Toshiba Satellite L500-13W**, buried in a storage box for over a decade, had once limped along on Windows 7. I’d previously installed Kali Linux, but it proved too heavy for the system’s aging specs. With constant overheating, keyboard misconfigurations, and disk errors, it seemed unusable.

Yet, with careful hardware fixes, a lighter OS, and support from ChatGPT, I brought it back to life — turning it into a **quiet, fast, and reliable cybersecurity lab machine**, ideal for my **Blue Team learning journey on a budget**.

## 🛠️ Hardware Specs & Initial Issues

- **RAM:** 4GB DDR3  
- **Storage:** 250GB 2.5″ SATA HDD (original)  
- **BIOS:** Legacy (no UEFI support)  
- **Ports:** USB 2.0 only — USB 3.0 drives not recognised  
- **Keyboard:** 🇵🇹 Portuguese layout, misconfigured  
- **Thermal issues:** Broken fan → overheating  
- **Storage issues:** Frequent boot errors on Kali Linux

## 🧠 Why I Chose MX Linux

ChatGPT recommended **MX Linux**, a lightweight Debian-based distribution. Here’s why it worked brilliantly for this old laptop:

- 🧱 Based on **Debian Stable** — reliable and secure  
- 🧑‍💻 XFCE desktop — lightweight, snappy, low memory usage  
- 🧩 Strong hardware compatibility — perfect for **legacy BIOS**  
- 🔧 Handy built-in tools — fan control, disk tools, easy configuration  
- 🛡️ Compatible with essential **cybersecurity tools**

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Repair & Installation

### 1. Fan Cleaning

I followed iFixit teardown instructions to open the chassis and **clean out the fan and vents**. This simple task drastically reduced overheating and shutdowns.

### 2. Bootable USB Creation

Using **Rufus** on a Windows machine, I flashed the latest **MX Linux 23** ISO to a USB 2.0 stick:

- Format: `FAT32`  
- Partition Scheme: `MBR`  
- Target System: `BIOS (or UEFI-CSM)`  
- Booted via BIOS (`F12`)

### 3. Disk Failure Warning

The first installation attempt triggered a **SMART warning**: the old HDD had high failure risk. I stopped and opted for a full replacement.

---

### 4. SSD Upgrade

I replaced the HDD with a **Crucial BX500 240GB SATA SSD** — affordable and compatible with this Toshiba model. The performance boost was immediate and noticeable.

---

### 5. Final Installation of MX Linux

- ❌ Chose **"Erase disk and install"** option  
- ⌨️ Keyboard: `Portuguese (pt)`  
- 🌍 Timezone: `Europe/Lisbon`  
- 📁 Partition: `ext4` with swap  
- 🧰 Post-install:
  ```bash
  setxkbmap pt
  sudo apt install tlp
  ```

## 🧰 Cybersecurity Tools Installed

These tools all run smoothly on MX Linux with just 4GB RAM:

| Category           | Tools                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Network Scanning   | `nmap`                                           |
| Packet Analysis    | `wireshark`                                      |
| System Auditing    | `lynis`                                          |
| AV & Vulnerability | `clamav`, `openvas`                              |
| Security Hardening | `fail2ban`, `ufw`                                |
| Dev & Scripting    | `python3`, `pip`, `Geany`, `git`, `VS Code`      |
